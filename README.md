Twitter Bubbles
==============

3D visualisation of geo-located tweets in the UK using jMonkeyEngine 3 and Twitter4J.

You will need to download jMonkeyEngine 3 and Twitter4J separately and configure your environment to work with them. They are not included in this bundle.

The sentiment analysis is yet to be implemented, and sentiment is currently assigned by a random number generator.
